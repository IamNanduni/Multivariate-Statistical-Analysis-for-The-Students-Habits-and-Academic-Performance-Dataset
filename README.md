# Multivariate-Statistical-Analysis-for-The-Students-Habits-and-Academic-Performance-Dataset
This project explores how studentsâ€™ lifestyle habits influence their academic performance using multivariate statistical techniques. The analysis is based on a dataset of 1,000 students with over 15 variables, including study hours, sleep patterns, social media usage, exercise frequency, mental health ratings, and exam scores.

By applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) in R, the project aims to:

-  Identify key patterns and latent factors in student habits and performance

-  Classify students into performance groups based on their lifestyle characteristics

-  Explore relationships between academic outcomes and well-being-related factors

The findings highlight the importance of study habits, wellness practices, and reduced digital distractions in achieving academic success.

ðŸ“Œ Tools & Technologies: R (MASS, caret, heplots, car, CCA, CCP, and other packages)

Feel free to explore the code, data insights, and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the multivariate relationships uncovered in this analysis.
